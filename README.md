# AutoValue: Car Price Prediction with Scikit-Learn

This repository contains **Machine Learning Project** for my portfolio: an end‚Äëto‚Äëend machine‚Äëlearning analysis implemented in a Jupyter notebook using **Python** and **scikit‚Äëlearn**. The project focuses on a tabular dataset (e.g., sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository) and demonstrates a clear workflow from exploratory analysis to model training and evaluation.

## üìå Project Requirements

**Deliverables.**
1. A Jupyter notebook (`ProjectOne_ML.ipynb`) that:
   - Loads and explores the dataset (EDA, handling missing values, feature preparation).
   - Implements **at least two** machine‚Äëlearning models (e.g., decision tree, SVM, neural network, na√Øve Bayes, clustering, or other appropriate models) and **justifies** the algorithm choices based on the **data characteristics** and/or **domain**.
   - Clearly calls out **three course concepts** applied in the analysis. Each concept should be explicitly labeled in the notebook (e.g., **Concept #1:** ‚ÄúWhen the dependent variable is skewed, evaluate with a confusion matrix and class‚Äëwise metrics, not only accuracy.‚Äù). These must be **my own independent analysis**.
2. A `README.md` (this file) summarizing the project, environment setup, how to run the notebook, and results.
3. `requirements.txt` (and optional `environment.yml`) for reproducibility.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Objective.** Build and compare regression models to predict **used car prices**.
- **Dataset.** A tabular car listings dataset (e.g., make, model, year, mileage, transmission, fuel type, condition, region). Use a dataset **not** previously used in this course.
- **Problem type.** **Regression** (target = price). If price has heavy tails or outliers, consider robust metrics (MAE, MedAE) and transformations (log-price).
- **Models to consider.** Linear Regression (with regularization), Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost/LightGBM if allowed), SVR, MLPRegressor.
- **Key concepts (examples).**
  - **Concept #1 (Data leakage prevention via proper CV and preprocessing pipelines).**
  - **Concept #2 (Feature encoding & scaling for mixed numeric/categorical data).**
  - **Concept #3 (Evaluation with regression metrics beyond R¬≤‚ÄîMAE, RMSE, MedAE).**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Activate your environment (pip or conda).
2. Launch Jupyter and open `ProjectOne_ML.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells sequentially. Fill in any dataset‚Äëspecific steps (path, preprocessing) and ensure figures are saved to `figures/` if desired.
